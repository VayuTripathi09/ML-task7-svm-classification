# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classification

## 📌 Objective
Implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for **linear and non-linear classification** tasks, and visualize decision boundaries for better understanding.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Generate a synthetic dataset using `make_classification`.
2. Train a **Linear SVM** for linear separable data.
3. Train a **Non-linear SVM** using the **RBF kernel**.
4. Compare accuracy of both models.
5. Plot decision boundaries for visualization.

## 📊 Results
- Linear SVM accuracy printed in console.
- RBF (Non-linear) SVM accuracy printed in console.
- Visual plots showing classification regions.

## 📸 Example Output
